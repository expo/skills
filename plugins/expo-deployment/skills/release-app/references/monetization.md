# Monetization Setup

## Apple Small Business Program

If the developer plans to monetize, explain:

```
💰 Apple Small Business Program

If you expect to earn less than $1M per year, you can reduce Apple's commission from 30% to 15%!

To enroll:
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/programs/small-business-program/
2. Sign in with your Apple Developer account
3. Accept the terms and enroll

Requirements:
- Less than $1M in App Store proceeds in the previous year
- Must re-enroll each year
- All apps under your account qualify

This saves you 15% on every dollar earned. Definitely do this!
```

## Google Play's Reduced Fee

```
💰 Google Play's 15% Service Fee

Google automatically applies a 15% fee (instead of 30%) on the first $1M of earnings each year. No enrollment needed!

For subscriptions, it's even better:
- First year: 15%
- After year 1 of a subscription: 15%
```

## RevenueCat Setup (if using subscriptions)

If the user has subscriptions, recommend:

```
For subscriptions, I recommend RevenueCat. It handles:
- Receipt validation
- Cross-platform subscription status
- Analytics and insights
- Webhook integrations

Install: npx expo install react-native-purchases

# Expo Project Structure

A starting skeleton for a **new** Expo app — one with no committed folder structure yet.

**Apply only to new projects.** If the app already has a layout, follow its existing conventions and leave files where they are — a default to start from, never a standard to enforce or migrate toward. When unsure whether a project is new, ask before moving anything.

The whole layout, assembled from the rules below:

```
├── assets/
├── scripts/
├── src/
│   ├── app/                       # Expo Router routes ONLY — every file is a route
│   │   ├── api/                   #   server API routes, grouped here
│   │   │   ├── user+api.ts
│   │   │   └── settings+api.ts
│   │   ├── _layout.tsx
│   │   ├── _layout.web.tsx         #   platform-specific layout
│   │   ├── index.tsx

│   │   │   ├── cell.tsx
│   │   │   └── index.tsx
│   │   ├── bar-chart.tsx
│   │   ├── bar-chart.web.tsx        #   platform-specific variant

│   │   ├── home/
│   │   │   ├── card.tsx            #   used only by Home — not shared

## `src/` and `src/app`

Keep app code under `src/` to separate it from config files. Expo Router supports both `app/` and `src/app/` out of the box — to switch, move the folder and restart the bundler. The default template aliases `@/*` to `./src/*` in `tsconfig.json`.

`src/app` is **routes-only**: every file there becomes a route, so nothing else belongs in it. Everything below lives in sibling folders.

## components/ — reusable UI

Generic, reused UI (button, card, table) with one named export each. Name files in **kebab-case** (`bar-chart.tsx`), matching the default `create-expo-app` template. When a component grows, give it its own folder with the root in `index.tsx` and **colocate** its private sub-components beside it — the import path (`@/components/table`) stays unchanged.

## screens/ — screen bodies

Because `app/` files must be routes, complex screen UI that isn't reused has no home there. Once a screen grows big enough to need breaking out to separate components, put it in `screens/` and let each route just render its screen:

```tsx
import { Home } from "@/screens/home";

export default function HomeScreen() {
  // route-specific concerns only — e.g. read url params here
  return <Home />;
}
```

**Colocate** a screen's private components inside its folder (`screens/home/components/`). A bonus: the same screen can render under multiple routes.

## server/ + app/api/ — separate server code

Appending `+api` to a file in `app/` makes it a server **API route**. Server code is different from frontend code — it runs in a Node-like server environment (deployed with EAS Hosting or on [third-party services](https://docs.expo.dev/router/web/api-routes/#hosting-on-third-party-services)) and can read secret env vars (`process.env.X`, not just `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`). Keep it apart:

- Group all routes under `app/api/` → `/api/user`, `/api/settings`. This colocates them and avoids collisions (e.g. a `/user` screen and a `/user` route).
- Put shared server-only helpers in `src/server/`.
- Consider ESLint rules that fence `+api` files and `server/` off from frontend-only checks.

## Platform-specific code

Small differences: use `Platform.select` / `Platform.OS`. For larger ones, split into platform files instead of inline `if/else` — `bar-chart.tsx` + `bar-chart.web.tsx`, imported extension-free (`@/components/bar-chart`); Metro picks the right file per target.

- Props must be identical across variants.
- A default file (no platform extension) is always required — make it a no-op if the component is single-platform.
- Supported extensions: `.ios`, `.android`, `.native`, `.web`.

## Colocate styles and tests

- **Styles:** keep the `StyleSheet.create({ ... })` object at the bottom of the component file rather than in a separate `.styles` file.
- **Tests:** put `format-date.test.ts` next to `format-date.ts` (preferred over a separate `__tests__/` folder) so tested files are obvious at a glance.

## AI and config files

Agent instructions live at the repo root — `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, with project skills under `.claude/`. Other config and assets stay outside `src/`: `app.json` / `app.config.ts`, `eas.json`, `package.json`, `assets/`, and `scripts/`.
